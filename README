rjpres - Reveal-JS Presenter
============================

Provides convenient way to run Reveal-JS on local machine by 
providing a webserver and all the necessary JavaScript and CSS 
files required as part of the `rjpres` installation. 

*WORK IN PROGRESS - BUYER BEWARE (free only as in puppy...)*

INSTALL
-------

Clone from git, then install with

```
   python setup.py install
```

RUN
---

In some directory where you have a markdown (.md) file that will
be your presentation:

```
   rjp
```

and then access as <http://localhost:9999> from the same machine. You may optionally specify a base directory to serve from:

```perl
    rip my/base/dir
```

By default, access is limited to localhost. Use `-h` for help.

If you want to be able to access from other machines then see the `--allow` and `--open` options. **WARNING** - using these options this will set up a webserver running on your machine that exposes your
filesystem below the current directory to other machines on the network.

TO-DO
-----

  * make run with ZIP instead of dir (perhaps just use fuse?)
  * improve access control
  * add auto-page break mode that makes pages on sections where none are explicitly specified
