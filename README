rjpres - Reveal-JS Presenter
============================

Provides convenient way to run Reveal-JS on local machine by 
providing a webserver and all the necessary JavaScript and CSS 
files from the install of the rjpres modules. 

*WORK IN PROGRESS - BUYER BEWARE*

INSTALL
-------

Clone from git, run

   python setup.py install

RUN
---

In some directory where you have a markdown (.md) file that will
be your presentation:

   rjp

and then access as <http://localhost:9999>.

*WARNING* - this will set up a webserver running on your machine that exposes your
filesystem below the current directory.

TO-DO
-----

  * make run with ZIP instead of dir (perhaps just use fuse?)
  * make default be to response only to localhost requests
  * add some command line opts and documentation
